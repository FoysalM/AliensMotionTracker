# AliensMotionTracker
an aliens inspired motion tracker application written in python for raspberry pi inputs

The motion tracker application harnesses hardware features as follows:

- Digital compass and bearing conversion to pin point contact detection.
- Authentic detect and track sound output with distance increments.
- Display output via GPIO pin out.

This repository also includes the following:

- Bluetooth tag detection, this simulates life-form detection by detecting and following a designated bluetooth tag.
- Laser tag scoring system.

The GY-271 module used for this project has a different magnetic chip resulting in a 0d registation as opposed to the 1e registration from chip in the original repository.

This project is using the Waveshare 5" HDMI screen. Any display with HDMI-in will work just as well.
